# Diabetes Prediction System

## Special Thanks
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to **Nisha Ma'am** and **Pankaj Sir** for their invaluable guidance and support in the making of this product.

## Methodology
Our approach is a **non-invasive system** that works as follows:

1. The individual places their finger on the photodiode.
2. The 940nm transistors collect data related to cholesterol levels.
3. This cholesterol data is directly input into our **custom machine learning (ML) model**.
4. The **classification model** provides predictions that are displayed in our web application along with relevant graphical representations.

## Updates and Confidentiality
To ensure the confidentiality of our work and to allow for further fine-tuning and improvements, we have decided not to share the code or dataset publicly at this time. Instead, we have created an **unlisted video** showcasing the current progress and functionality of our product.
